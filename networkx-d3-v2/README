====================
Network Visualizer X
====================

******************************
Setting up a local environment
******************************

Network Visualizer X is a self-contained project. To run it you just need
to install `Google App Engine <https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads>`_.

This project uses `NDB <https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/>`_
for storing information in App Engine's datastore, and
`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ as web framework for handling everything else:
request process, template rendering, etc.

There are more dependencies included inside `lib` folder.

***************
OAuth2 Settings
***************

Network Visualizer X uses `OAuth2 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth#OAuth_2.0>`_
to access data from a Google spreadsheet. You'll need to register your application
with the APIs Console and generate `client_id` and `client_secret` keys. See
`Using OAuth 2.0 to Access Google APIs <https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2#basicsteps>`_

Once you've generated those keys, add them into `networkx/conf/dev.py`_ (copied from `networkx/conf/dev_template.py`_ )::

    OAUTH_SETTINGS['client_id'] = 'your_client_id'
    OAUTH_SETTINGS['client_secret'] = 'your_client_secret'

******************
Running the server
******************

The process for running the server is the standard one for any Google App Engine
application. Inside the project folder run::

    $ dev_appserver.py .

And you will have your server running at http://localhost:8080


**********
Test suite
**********

For running the test suite included within this project, you'll need to install
the python package `Mock <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/>`_. There
are several options for installing it, but the easiest way is to use
`easy_install`::

    $ easy_install mock

Once you have mock installed in your system, you can run the test suite just
by executing::

    $ python manage.py test --settings=networkx.conf.tests auth clients core graph

Deploy
******

For deploying the application, you just need to follow `Google App Engine's
instructions for deploying applications
