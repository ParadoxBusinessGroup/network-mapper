This is a collection of tools for visualizing networks of support. For example,
a live version used by Al-Jazeera to track defections from the Syrian regmine to
the revolutionary opposition that started in 2009 is available here:

The subdirectory 'networkx-d3-v2' contains the current (in development) version
that uses D3 to visualise the network graph.

The subdirectory 'networkx-ft-v1' contains a version that uses
the fusion-tables network graph visualisation.
